# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-System-Using-a-Stacked-Hybrid-Scoring-Model
A real-time fraud detection framework built using a stacked hybrid scoring model that blends ensemble and statistical learning methods to identify fraudulent transactions with high precision. Designed scalability and model interpretability.

## Features
- Live transaction streaming from FastAPI endpoint  
- Real-time fraud prediction with a Stacked hybrid scoring model (that combines the benefits of Random Forest, LightGBM and CatBoost)  
- SHAP-based local + global explanations  
- Automatic data drift detection using KS test  
- Live metrics (precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, ROC curve)  
- Downloadable transaction report (CSV) 

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Streamlit** – interactive dashboard  
- **FastAPI** – live backend  
- **LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest** – fraud detection model  
- **SHAP**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** – interpretability and visualization
